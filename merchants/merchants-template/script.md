## Taler Docs Info:

The template is a backend feature that is used to allow wallets to create an order. This is useful in cases where a store does not have Internet connectivity or where a Web site wants to enable payments on a purely static Web page (for example to collect donations). In these cases, the GNU Taler wallet can be used to set up an order (and then of course pay for it).

The template itself primarily provides order details that cannot be changed by the customer when the wallet creates the order. The idea is that the user may be prompted to enter certain information, such as the amount to be paid, or the order summary (as a reminder to themselves or a message to the store), while the template provides all of the other contract details.

The typical user experience with templatates is that the user first scans a QR code or clicks on a taler://-URI which contains a pay-template (see LSD 0006). The URI specifies which values the user should supply, currently either nothing, the amount, the order summary, or both. The URI may also specify defaults or partial defaults for those values. After the user has supplied those values, the wallet will use the public template API to create the order, then fetch the order details, and proceed as if it had been given the respective pay URI in the first place: show the full contract details and allow the user to make a payment. If the user chooses to abort the payment, the wallet should give the user the opportunity to edit the values and create another order with different values. If the template does not include any values that the user is allowed to edit (so it is basically a fixed contract), the wallet should directly create the order and immediately proceed to the contract acceptance dialog.

The business process for the templating API is also pretty simple. First, the
private API is used to setup (or edit) the template, providing all of the
contract terms that subsequently cannot be changed by the customer/wallet.
This template data is then stored under the template ID which can be freely
chosen and must be in URL-encoded format. The SPA should also make it easy
for the merchant to convert the template ID into a taler://-URI and/or QR code.
Here, the merchant must additionally specify the defaults (if any) for the
customer-editable values. Afterward, the merchant can print out the QR code
for display at the store, add a link to the taler://-URI and/or embed the
respective QR-code image into their Web page.


To receive a payment confirmation, the merchant may choose to configure a webhook in the merchant backend on the pay action, for example, to send an SMS to their mobile phone. For points-of-sale without a mobile phone or Internet connectivity, the OTP mechanism can also be used to confirm payments.
